            <br />
            <p>Reflecting οn everything and everyone that it took to set this up and on all of you beautiful people that
                showed up for it.</p>

            <div className="quote">
                <p>🎶It started out as a feeling that then grew into a hope...</p>

            <div className="italic-p">
                <p>And then you say that quiet word out loud to someone that not only gets it but also encourages it!

                <p>Someone who doesn’t let you wiggle your way off the hook when all those doubts and difficulties
                    inevitably begin to appear.</p>
                <p>Funny how when you begin to ground a private heart centered dream or idea into reality something
                    inside you goes-</p>
                <p>‘Oh-oh something new and different might happen here... STOP!!!’</p>

            <div className="quote">

            <div className="italic-p">
                <p>Maria used to cringe at the idea of being introduced as a ‘life coach’ - a fact her new partner
                    Giorgo picked up on immediately and enjoyed exploiting every chance he got…</p>
                <p>He also couldn’t help but notice Maria’s goat-like habits of roaming around the island climbing all
                    the rocky hills.</p>
                <p>Quickly ‘This is maria- she is a life coach!’ turned into <strong>‘This is Maria, she is a life
                        goat!’</strong></p>
                <p>Little did he expect what would happen next…</p>
                <p>Maria shared it with Natasa and immediately it was on!</p>
                <p><strong>Life Goats! That’s it!</strong></p>
                <p>We named it and then it really started to roll…</p>
                <p><strong>It was no longer just a nice idea… Invitations were sent, accommodations and logistics
                        organised, and team members ‘recruited’ ;) Natasa even put together a website to keep us on
                        point!
                        → <a href="https://www.lifegoats.com">www.lifegoats.com</a></strong></p>
                <p>Which with a ‘little’ help from our friends, all led up to our first happy gathering in May.</p>

            <p>At the end of October, an opportunity to just BE with each other, spending time outside in the fresh air
                without any ambitious route plans. Natasa introduced us to Skala Gorge, located very close to her family
                village Adam. We also got to spend a little time at the Land and hiking around the lower altitudes of
                Mount Olympus.

                <p>Also, we are open to lending this space to any of you that may feel inspired to share something with
                    the group in the future. We love hearing from you :)</p>
