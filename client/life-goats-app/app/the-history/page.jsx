          <p>Mount Olympus has always had a special place in my heart.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Let's rewind…</p>
          <br />
          <p>Four years old: The indoctrination begins…</p>
          <br />
          <p>Kenosha, Wisconsin. Small kitchen table against the wall with four chairs. A map of Greece plastered on the wall and a small pin on this specific location at the foot of the mountain, a kilometer away from the sea.</p>
          <br />
          <p>A place we, my family, learned to call ‘The Land’.</p>
          <br />
          <p>My parents purchased this piece of land in 1988. Surrounded by farm fields, it was far from the touristic villas and vacation homes of our peers, but the location was phenomenal!</p>
          <br />
          <p>Breakfast with a view of the mountain and less than a ten-minute walk to the beach, my siblings and I spent our summers and long weekends there, away from the big concrete jungle of the city of Thessaloniki where we moved to in 1994.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Exploring mountain trails and endless hours at the beach, we camped at the Land as often as the weather conditions allowed.</p>
