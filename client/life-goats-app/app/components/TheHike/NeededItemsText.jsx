      <p>The mountain has its quirks just as every hiker has their own 😉</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Based on our experience, we are recommending the following list of
        needed items for a 2-3 hike with 1-2 nights spent at a mountain
        refuge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although October is typically fair weathered, never underestimate the
        mountain! It is not always sunny on the mountain, even during the
        summer, and especially the upper parts of the mountain can disappear in
        thick clouds really quickly and temperatures do still drop below 0°C at
        night towards the top of high mountains like Mount Olympus.
