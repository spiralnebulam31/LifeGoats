Climbing up the misty mountain, being part of something bigger than myself and having opportunity to be part and be held by group of amazing people with big hearts (even those head brainers ;-). It is experience I will cherish forever. Experience worth sharing."]

Being on the mountain, away from the chaos of the city, surrounded by nature and other like-minded people, filled me with energy and gave me the clarity to see what's important to me. Returning to my routine after the Life Goats retreat, I realized I could see things from a calmer perspective. That helped me organize my next steps towards my life and career goals."],

    text: ["Maria and her family organised something really nice from the sea level to the top of the mountain. Interesting and nice people together around the table in a beautiful yard with great food and nice conversations from the heart. Then, the hike. For me as a beginner in hiking, the suggested equipment written in this site, helped me a lot to enjoy the hike, because you have to be as light as possible. Words cannot describe the awe you feel at the top of the mountain. Maria and Savvas made a team really responsible, patient and respectful to everybody. We enjoyed the paths, the nature and the company! I am really grateful that i lived this beautiful experience and hope to do¬†it¬†again¬†soon!"],

    text: ["It was so enjoyable being on a team with all of you. It's a picture of life in a nut shell. Learning to trust life in a team as you ascend the mountain. Everyone has their unique role to play. Bringing to the experience their strengths and weaknesses, relying on each other when we are about to fall to catch us, or giving encouragement when we start to tier and think we can't go on. Even little things like lending a pair of gloves or soaks when yours are wet, fixing your bettons when they brake or just need adjusting or giving you water or a sweet to keep you going. There are so many ways that we take for granted that people are there for us. It's good to reflect and be grateful for are the big and small ways people are there for us. Thank you all for all those ways you were there for me on this fantastic journey we took together. God bless you all. Looking forward to seeing you all again."],
